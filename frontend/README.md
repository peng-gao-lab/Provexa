# Provexa UI

This is the frontend for Provexa. ProvQL queries can be executed in the Jupyter-like cells and resulting outputs would be displayed in an interactive graph. 


## Quick Start

1. First install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the WebUI:

```
npm start
```

3. (Optional) In some setups, there might be an issue with OpenSSL compatability. In such cases, use this command instead:

```
npm run start-legacy
```
